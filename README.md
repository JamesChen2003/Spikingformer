# Spikingformer: Spike-driven Residual Learning for Transformer-based Spiking Neural Network
Spikingformer have achieved 77.64% in ImageNet 2012, 80.75% in CIFAR100, 95.94% in CIFAR10, 81.4% in CIFAR10-DVS, 98.6% in DVS Guesture, achieving the best results in all the above five datasets. 
We have built a novel and pure spiking neural network model based on transformer, named Spikingformer, which is the state-of-the-art in directly trained SNNs models. 
Paper and code are coming soon !
